Made chess in JS

Implemented all the piece logic (and literally everything) from scratch. Definitely not the best way to do it but 99% of it works. No indication of checkmate though (definitely not because I can't figure out how to fix it).

Technologies used: Javascript/HTML/CSS, Socket.io, Node.js, Express.
